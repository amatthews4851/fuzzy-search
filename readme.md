# search-filterer

A fuzzy search library using a slightly tweaked Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance algorithm

## Installation

To install, use your package manager of choice:

```shell
yarn add search-filterer
```

```shell
npm install --save search-filterer
```

## Exports

All functions listed here are curried, memoized, and are named exports. They will return a new list consisting of items in the `list` that passed the checks. To use, simply

```ts
import { search, objectSearch } from "search-filterer";

const myList = ["foo", "bar", "baz"];

const results = search("bar", myList); // ["bar", "baz"]

const myListOfObjects = [
  { foo: "dog", bar: { baz: "cat" } },
  { foo: "mouse", bar: { baz: "hamster" } }
];

const objectResults = objectSearch(
  "hamster",
  ["foo", "bar.baz"],
  myListOfObjects
); // [{foo: "mouse", bar: {baz: "hamster"}}]
```

```ts
type search = (query: string, list: [string]) => [string];
```

Just a standard search. Takes a string query and a list of strings and returns a list strings, filtered down to strings that are one mutation or less away from containing the query.

---

```ts
type vagueSearch = (query: string, list: [string]) => [string];
```

Just like the `search()` function but a bit looser on what is accepted

---

```ts
type objectSearch<T> = (query: string, keys: [string], list: [T]) => [T];
```

Searches the `list` of objects using the arrays of `keys`, matching the, with the `query`. You can supply a key like `"foo"` to look for the value of `list[0]?.foo`, or supply a path using dot syntax like `"foo.bar.baz"` to search `list[0]?.foo?.bar?.baz`.

---

```ts
type objectSearch<T> = (query: string, keys: [string], list: [T]) => [T];
```

Exactly the same as `objectSearch()` except looser on what is accepted

---

`searchPreservingOrder()`, `vagueSearchPreservingOrder()`, `objectSearchPreservingOrder()`, `vagueObjectSearchPreservingOrder()` are all the same as their base functions, but the list returned preserves the same order as the `list` argument that was passed in.
